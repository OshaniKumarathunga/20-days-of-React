# Favorite Movies App

This project is a simple React application designed to practice handling user interactions with forms and state management. It allows users to add, remove, and mark movies as favorites. The application demonstrates the use of various React concepts such as functional components, state management, and event handling.

## Features

- **Add Movies**: Input field for adding new movie titles to the list.
- **Display Movies**: A list of movies added by the user.
- **Mark as Favorite**: Button to mark or unmark movies as favorites, visually distinguished in the list.
- **Remove Movies**: Button to remove movies from the list.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to practice the following React concepts:

- **Handling forms and user inputs** in React using controlled components.
- **Managing state** with React hooks (`useState`) to dynamically update the movie list.
- **Handling events** such as form submissions, button clicks for adding, removing, and marking movies as favorites.
- **Conditional rendering** to change the appearance of favorite movies.
- **Component composition** by breaking down the application into smaller, reusable components.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- **Creating and managing forms** in React, including handling form submissions and input validation.
- **State management** using React's `useState` hook to keep track of movies and their properties.
- **Component-based architecture** by dividing the app into `MovieInput` and `MovieItem` components for better code organization.
- **Styling in React** to enhance the user interface, including dynamic styling based on component state.
