# React Forms Practice

This project is a simple React application built to practice handling forms in React. It demonstrates the use of various input elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, select dropdowns, and file uploads within a form. The application uses functional components and React hooks to manage form state, handle form submissions, and display the collected data.
